Wendover, “monachi 0111111111 exhibuerunt humanitatem,”
and him our author follows.

, p. 80.1. 1. Here he is certainly copying Matt Par,
as he follows him in his statement 01 the length 01
Pope Alexander's papacy, from which Wendover differs,
but soon afterwards goes off to the headings from the
MS. of Wendover.

p. 821. 29. Ηο10 10 another carious instance 01 the
sudden change from one chronicler to the other, in
the account 01 the first acts of Richard I. See the
note on the passage.

p 8817. episcopan 11111111. Matt Par„ whois
the authority here, omits the 11111111, which Wendover
gives. Βο1011,.1122,21, the readings dotorchwa and

The question, as 10 which Ms. of Matthew Paris he
had access, is easily answered5-it must have been the
Cotton MS. [Wats’s O.]‚ or a MS. 011110 same recen-

additions peculiar to that MS.; c. y. p. 65, the capture
of the Earl of Glouoester; p. 99, the account 01 King
John’a taning the Cisteroians3 p. 108, the defeat
of the Frenoh fleet under Eustaoe the monk, 10 which
our author has added some additional details3 and
111 p. 110 the mention of Henry III.’s seat In one
instance he seems to have used the MS. 01 the Historia
Minor, in giving, p. 102, Baebelo instead 01 Stamfcrd,
as the place where the barone met in 1215.
