Strattons‚ clerk in the exchequer,¹ who isdeseribed
as being errested on two separate occasions. The first
time (p. 171) he was accused of homicide, sedition,
and other excesses Bcsides vast treasures, an oraro·
rt'wot, containing evidences of magical practices, was dis-
covered in his possession, which he destroyed, in spite
oi the royal scal having been placed upon them. The
second offenoe (p. 180) was the forgery of a deed He
had received a monor from the prior of Bermondsey
sor his lile, and by removing the scal and placing it
upon another deed of his own composing, he altered
this into a gift to himself and his heirs. He was
punished with perpetual imprisonment during the
king's pleasure. ΤΙιο very interesting account of the
company and the dresses- 915 citizens of London
dressed out in their “breveria'' (prudentiae), and
ladies dancing through the streete-at the marriage
ol the princess Margaret to John ol’ Brabent in 1290,
ispeculiar to our chronicler. Besides these must be
mentioned the details respecting the quarrel with
Flanders in the same year, and the arrival of the
eounts of Holland and Oleves to join the king in Soot

Norwich MS. as originally written. It is followed by
the document giving the submissior of the claimants
ol the crown of Scotland to Edward 1., the annale of
the years 1291, 2, as given in the Appendix D., and
Magna Charta, and the other documents of which
mention has been mede above.
