xxxviii PREFAOE.

1116 666161661-16 mentioned twice from different chro-
niclers. We find frequently faulty construetione—sen·
tences entirely without verbs; the form of a clause 6ο
altered as to lose its meaning, and the facts themselves
sometimes distorted by 66161666 abbreviation.

Resides the above chroniclers‚ among the names in
the 16661 margin will not unfrequemtly be observed
that of Matthew of Westminster. As the work which
goes under this name is carried down to 1307, and as
this portien of the present work was certainly com·
posed 666 16661 61166 1272,l our author certainly could
not have hed the former chronicle in its present shepe.
It is worthy of especial remark 61166 by far the greater
part of the insertione common to our chronicis, and
that called Matthew of Westminster's, consiste ,of notioes
of ecclesiasticol changes, and especially of those in the

diocese of Norwich. See pp. 49, 53, 54, 56, 68, 67, 68,

77, 78, 116.Β Τ1116 might at first sight lead 6666 sup-
pose that this was the original, and that the author of
the Floras Historiarum had mede 666 61 these Norwich
annale as one of his authorities. Buta closer examina
tion into the passages common 6ο 6116 two has led me to
believe ¹that the N orwich compiler is not 6116 original of
the'two. One or two metanoea will make this clear.
