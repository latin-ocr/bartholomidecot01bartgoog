copied, and some fresh ones introduced.¹ That it is a
copy, the following piece of evidence, among nrany others,
appears conclusive. In pp. 112131, the author refers
to the sentence of excommunicabion as to be found
“post Cartam de Foresta immediate'’; the N orwich MS.
adds, “in ultimo quaterno,'’ i. e. in the last sheet, where
lt will be found in the place mentioned among the other
documenta: the writer of the Cotton MS. (where these
documenta do not appear at all) has copied this exactly,
hut has expuncted the words ‘¹ in ultimo quaterno‚” as in-
tending to insert the documenta, if at all, in some other
place. There can be little doubt that the Cotton MS.
was intended to he a word for word copy of the other,
as ser as it goes-as the collation of the earlier portion
(Appendix H.) shows how very triding are the varia
tione between the two, and the few words occasionally
omitted may well have been due to the scribe's careless-
ness. The only exceptione to this are the omission of the

foolish legend of the demon in Hereford cathedral,
(see Appendix B.) p. 179 (this, however, the Norw. MS.
itself directa to he omitted)‚-of the passage given in
the note, p. loz-and of the very curicus comparison
of J ohn de Kirkeby to St. John the Baptiet, in p. 174.

The conclusion to which this comparison leads is, Inacho-
think, that Bartholomew Cotton hae no claim to that ¹⁰¹²¹⁰W ⁰⁰*
