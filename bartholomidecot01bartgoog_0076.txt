presented to him hythe olergy in 1297 (p. boisy-and
his seizure of the wool, which the chronioler considers
a chief cause of the troubles with the earl marshal
and other nobles (p. 338). Almost the only persone]
remark in the whole history is the author's thanks·
giving at the peace between the king and the nobles, and
the immediate pursuit of the war against the Scotch
(p. 339), showing how strong the feeling must have been
at the time in England² The history ends abruptly
with' the retum of the king aster the victory of Fal-
kirk to Oadisle, and the retirement of the Sootch into

Galloway.

Enough, it is believed, has been said to show the
nc great value ol this chronicle for the history of the first
*⁰⁰- twenty·five years of the reign of Edward 1. llre facts

are clearly told, without, apparently, any unjust bias
to either side, when the author isrelating the quarrels
between the king and the olergy or the barons. In
the former case, while tbe difficulty in which the
olergy stood between the necessity of disobedienoe to
the Pope or the king is distinctly stated, there is no
exaggeratiou of the sufferings of the olergy, or the
tyranny of the king. The author’s sincere joy at the
restoration of internal peaoe throughout the country is
the only expressiones feeling that escapes him. He
must clearly have had very great means oi collecting
facte, as well of those that took plaoe close at hand
in bis own or the neighbouring counties, as of those at
a distance, and he has certainly made the beat use of

his opportunities
