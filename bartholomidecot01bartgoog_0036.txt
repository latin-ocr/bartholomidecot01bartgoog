and later portione ef the Cotton MS, which arenot
contained in the N anvich MS, is se entirely unlike that
of the middle portion which is, and the manner of
abridging other authors so different, thet it is‘scareely
' possible that they can be by the same author. And
there seems no reason why Bartholomc'w Cotton, having
necess to this N orwich Me, should not have copied it, or
caused it te be copied, for a large portion oi the second
hook of his history, just as he has taken'Geoffrey of
Moumouth for the first. External evidence in favour of
his being the author there is none; the words Chronica
Cottonis on folio 1Ι oi the Norwich MS. having been
written, as may be seen in the facsimile, seme centurias
alter the MS. itself, end probably only in consequence of
its identity with a portion ef the Cotton MS. which
actually bears Bartholomew’s name. As to who the
author was, itis oi course impossible to conjecture,
except thet hc was a mouk of Norwich3 indeed the
latter portion may very well have been the productiora
of various persons in the monastery filling up the annale
from year te year as the events occurred. And were it
not for the use that Bartholomew Ootton has made of it,
it might have appeared under the title of Annales Nor-
wicensas, and ranked with the Dunstable‚ Worcester,
Waverley, cr other monastick annals3 and indeed this
is the title given by Wharton te the few extracta hc
has printed from it. Searl, formerly registrar of the
cathedral oi Norwich, in a history of the cathedral,

’ written in 1659, cites a register belonging to the church,

which seems to be the present volume, and states itte
be by a monk called Willelmus de Mannington It
would be interesting to know his authority for this
statement¹ The only name now on thebookis theton
