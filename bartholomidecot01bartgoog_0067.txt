count 01 the riots in which 001101 the cathedrel ond {²1} {lg'ffl ·
11101110110010101 were bumt in 1272. This is-perhaps the
best known portiones our author’s history, as besides
having formed the source from which all historiens of
Norwich (either 01 first or second 1101111) have derived
their accounts of this event, it is extrected at length
in Wharton‚ 111 Dugdale, and in Blomefield's History
of Nor-folla The latter treats it 00 the work 01 0
partiaco, making 011100 good a case as possible 101
the 1110111111. There seems in reality no cause for ench
1111 0011110ος 0 11101111 himself, our author naturally
does not view the 1101010 with any particular kindness;
but the account bears every appearance 01 being 011
honest one, and the writer mentions thc 1000110 which
the citizens put forwerd. Very 11111 details 01 the
