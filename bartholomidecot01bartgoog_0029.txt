A question may naturally arise es 10 the way in which¹¹1¹¹¹way¹¹l¹¹¹g⁸
suoh a chroniele as the present was composed. Did the 01080100

write 11, abridging from MSS. before him as he went ontmad
Or did he ‚‚lastly alter witha pen the MS 01 he chromele
he took es hisauthority 110111 111110 10 111110, putting marks
to guido asoribe what 10 insert end what 10011111, in
eopying the whole out in a fair 11011111 The evidenee to
be derived from the plan pureued‘ in the present volume
1010101011 01 011 these methods being used at different
times Many 01 the obvious blunders are just what
would 110 eeused by the soribe's ineorreotly hearing what
was dietated to him; many 01 the unfinishsd sentenees
are just sueh ae might be written by a person dietating

additions are suoh as might be written 011 the margin 01

these points ester some details have been given 01 the

have been eompiledor abridged. ’

I turn 1101 to the author and the MSS. of hie history.

Beyond the 1001 that Bartholomew Cotton, 01 Delli

nothing whatever 10 known 01 him. This 1001 10 stated
in the eolophon to the present work:

“Explicit Tractatus de Archiepiseopis et Episeopis

“Anglira compilatus a fratre Bartholomaeo de Cotton,
