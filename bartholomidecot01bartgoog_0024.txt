whichI believe to be the compiler's own, in type
of the ordinary size. It will be seen thet he conti·
uuelly introduces single words, os pointing out more
distinctly the person spoken 01⁸3 affixing, for instance,
the word ccc to the neme cf s king, or produces,
when sppliceble. These I heve elwsys printed in the
lorge type, iu which, of course, ull the actual additions
of the compilet sppwr. Wherc hebes omitted suy-
thing, either wolde or sentences, ss is eontinuslly
the cese, I heve indicated the omission by the usual
now of points. At the fect of the pege will be found
s collstion cf the author who is sbridged or copied,
sufficiently full to show all tbe differenoes of eny im-

perfect consistency in the plen adopted. Sometimes
the most trifling veriotion will show which chronielcr
our euthor is following, while it would be clearly
unsdviseble always to give every varieticn of e oon-

end the like, which ere indiscriminately employed.

’ In mony ceses the author gives an cbridgment
of e sentence of greater or less length, in his own
lengusge. In these ceses, where it hasbeen clearly
derived from his original, I have printed it in the
smsller type, though the words moy be different, end
heve put the word ‘obridged' in o note et the foot
of the page. In sll other ceses it is to be supposed
thet the exact words of the original ere followed by
cur author.
