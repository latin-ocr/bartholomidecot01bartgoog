5. A list of Kings of Englend from the Conquest to
Edward I.‚ of Archbishops of Oanterbury from Lanfrcnc
to Robert de Kylewardby3 of Bishops of N orwich from
Herbert to William de Middeltune¹ and of Priore of Nor-
wioh from ingulfus to Williem de Kyrkebi, which various
later hands have continued to William Cestleton.

In comparing this with the Cotton MS. it will be

Book II. of the history, omitting all the account of the
Anglo-Sexon period. And as it terminatos with the
year 1290, though an important, it is but the smaller,
portion of the work to which Bartholcmew Cotton has
given his necne.

That it is en original document there can be no doubt
—judging from the style and appearance of the writ-

and ink of much the same colour, is employed till 1264,
after which sometimes the former ond sometimes other
hands are used 3 and the ink shows the entries tc have
been made et different times, cs if each year’s events
were written down as they happened It will be seen

which the chronicler seems first to have followed no
externcl authority. It is somewhat remarkable that
when the chronicler again finds an author to follow
(Everisden), scarcely any of the work is to be found
in this MS, which stops in the middle ofe word. (See
p. 161, note ³.)

Now the Cotton MS. is written in the same hand

throughout without any variation, and in the portion
common to the two MSS. is evidently a most servile
copy of the N orwich MS, almost all its blunders being
