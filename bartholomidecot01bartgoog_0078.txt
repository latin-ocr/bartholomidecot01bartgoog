Malmesbury, “De Gestis Pontificum.’' An introduc·
tion is prefixed, compiled from Geoffrey of Monmonth,
Florenoe oi Woroester, Henry of Huntingdon, and other
sources, which are sufficiently indicated in the margin.
After the bishops given by Malmesbury, the names of
those that follow, usually as far as the year 1220, are
given, but rarely anything besides, To this there are
two chief exceptione-the accounts of the archbishops of
Cantorbury and the bishops of Norwioh, which are
carried down to the author's time, and are of con·
siderable interest and valuc. The accounts of the latter
have been continued as far as J ohn Salmon by a later

intention of completing tho whole sericeas the page is
always left blank after the account of each bishopriclr.
The account oi the bishops of Norwich has been
printed by Wharton in his Anglia Sacro, vol„ i, pp.
sos-412. Besides these, the lists ol the archdeaoon·
ries 'and rural deaneries given in many of the dio-
ceses appear to be original, and there are frequent minor
additions to Malmesbury's account. The dates given in

the margin have been taken from Mr. Hardy's edition
of Le Neve’s ‘¹ Fasti.”

Documenta The documenta printed in the Appendix will speak
{imin for themselves; the Papal letter against the citizens
pendia oi N orwioh has been hequently alluded to, though it

now appears in print for the first time. This, and

indeed the whole of the present chronicle, gives a
remarkable idea of the importauoe of the city of Nor·
wich at this date; these riots‚ for instance, engagIng
the attention, not only of the wliole kingdom, but of

the court of Rome. The annals of the two years 1291
and 1292 from the Norwioh Ms, besides many local
