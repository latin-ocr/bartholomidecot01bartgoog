PREFACE. xxix

p. 15. iti. H. H. is mentioning a battle fought by
Edclhelm, “ apud Port cum exercitu Westsexiae;” by
the omission of com nestro, an entirely ‹lillerent and
very incorreot meaning is obtained.

p. 18. l. 7. By considerable omissione, which ren-
dered the introduction of the words cluo repes corvum
proedc'ctc' necessary, our author hos stated thot both
Basreng and Haldene fell at waning, though the latter
is mentioned as olive afterwards ¹

p. 19. 1. 4. com predictis sepibus ; all previous
mention of these hes been omitted, though the word
predictis has been allowed to remain. Immediately
below, l. 7, the destruction of the Danish fleet is attri-
buted to Alfred, instead of the tempest. This, however,
is caused as much by what is inserted as by what is
omitted.

p.32.1.11. 'Phe singular omission of the words
introduced in brackets cau hardly be intentional, and
the scribe may easily have been misled by the recurrence
of the word hidis. This would go to prove that the
nbridgment was not written out from dictation.

p. 37. l. 37. In the account of the tax, the omission
of the sum which the Londoners hed previously paid
completely alters the sense of the passage.

p. 33. l 5. In enumerating the countries over which
Onut reigned, Decio has been unaccountably omitted.
