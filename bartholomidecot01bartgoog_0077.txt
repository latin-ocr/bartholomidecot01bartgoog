On the other hand, the careless way in which the .
earlier portion of the volume-the abridgement of older
chroniclers-has been performed, may give some reason
to suspect the accuracy of a narrator who has proved
himself so careless a compilet. But independently ol'
the suppositicn, for the truth of which I think ample
grounds have been shown, that the latter and earlier
portione of the chroniele are by different hands, it is
reasonable to expect that far more pains would he
taken by a historian while collecting facts for himself,
the while only hastily abridging the work of another.
And many of the errore are simply repetitions of those
of his authorities This is especially the case with the
earlier portione of many of the annale oompiled in the
way of our author's for the respective monasteries in
which they were preserved.¹ And in what is the
origiue] portion of this history very few errors, and
these of very small moment, have been discovered

We conclude then with Dr. ΡειιιΙίρ that this is one of
the most important sources l'or the history of Edward Ι.
