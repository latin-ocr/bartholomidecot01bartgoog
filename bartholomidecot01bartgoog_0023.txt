new recital of old oues, would be saved the trouble ol'
reading over what they have already known elsewhere.

Another advantage, too‚is to be gained by this pro· Adven-
cess3 a collation of the text of the author whom the *ffiffbbe

done with sufficient care, will show which of the MSS, ⁰²⁸⁸·
and so in some cases which revision of his author's
text (in cases where there is known to have been more
than one) he' hus followed; and thus will prove that
such revision is at least as old as the date of the
copyist, and most probably that one most in vogue
at the time And by this means it may be possible
to recover the genuine text, or et least to ascertain
which of the MSS. approaches nearest to it, of some of
our older chroniclers. Again‚ itis most important in
weighing the evidence for a historical fact to remember
thot the same principle according to which creditis
given toa particular reading, also applies to theeredit
we attach to a particular fact “If of twenty MSS.
⁴‘ agreeing in any reading, nineteen can be proved to
‘¹ have ¹been copied from the twentieth‚ the reading
“ manifestly does not rest on the authority of twenty
“ MSS. but oi one’'¹ So if we find a fact stated by
any number oi different chroniclers, and we can preve
that all aster the first are indebted for their knowledge
oi it to him, the fact must rest solely on the credit
due to this one, and he alone should be quoted as its
authority. Thus, for instem, it is surely incorrect to
quote Heni-y of Huntingdon as an additional authority
for those facts which he' has manifestly taken from
Bede'or hom the Sason Chronicle. ¹ ’ ’
