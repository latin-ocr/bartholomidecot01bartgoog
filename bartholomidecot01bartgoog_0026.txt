Ithink it can be proved that hc had both the MSS. on
his desk, and continually turned from one ιο the other.
Very apparently trifling changes have shown me which
of the two is his original from time ιο time.

Theochqt, One point must· be especially borne in mind. My

ffiffiffl object is not to ascertain who is the original authority

audonty. for any fact or statement, but-who is my author’s
authorityl Which of the chroniclers we have now in
print did he take as his guida ior the facts he relatesl
For instance, in referring a fact to Roger oi Wendover,
and the next to Matthew Paris,I do not mean ιο imply
rwccssurily that the secandis not in the former’s work,
but that I believe my author ιο have changed from the
one ιο the other in his compilation. The reasons ior
this, when the collation at the foot oi the page does not
show them, will at once be seen by a reference to the
chronicler whose nemeis placed in the margin The
mathod followed has been to place in the inner margin
of tho page the name of the authority which ie supposed
to be continually employed, excepting at the passages
which are printed in larger type, until another appears
in ita place. In some few metanaeas in pp. 1, 2,) the
names of authorities are given in the margin opposite to
matter printed in larger type, because they seemed the
actual source from which thalcote had been obtained,
though the author has by alteration made the passages
entirely his own. In the latter portion of the workI

have occasionally inserted the names of authorities in the
