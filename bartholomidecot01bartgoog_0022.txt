Χ “ PREFACE.

publish an abridgment of a well-known work, where the
· lenguage is frequently injured, and the facts oocesionelly
distorted, by the careless way in which the abridgment
is made, was in no way to be desired And thus the
way in which our author hae hurried ov'er his account
of the early history of Englend, and indeed almost the
whole work till he comes to his own time, has pre-
