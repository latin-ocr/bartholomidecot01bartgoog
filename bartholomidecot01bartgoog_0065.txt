being the chronicle of Taxster, and has mentioned his
name in the preface, has called the chronicle itself
“ Continuatio Chronici Florentii Wigorniensis.''

The portion in the present volume, short as it is, is
ao important, and the printed edition so defective,
that 1 have thought it right to collate all the above
MSS. with care, as also to point out the defects oi
the printed edition lt will be seen that I have been
ableto give several passages with greater correctness
than they have previously appeared. The reading
ceilam for ancilium in p. 139, t 18, which is given
in two MSS, is a striking instance of the necessity
of collating all the copies of a chronicle that exist.

We know the author’s nume from the two MSS.
which contain his chronicle without any other. Julius
A. 1. gives it thus:

“Hoc anno [1244] scriptor praesentis voluminis
“habiturn suscepit monachicum, dictus J . de Taxster,
‘⁴ die Sancti Edmundi.'’

The same is given in Arund. 6, except that there
“de Tayster” is read for ‘⁴ J. de Taxster.'' This
passage follows the word “ interiectu est” in thc
printed edition, p. 179. l. 30. The portion of the
chronicle that is printed, which is all that is of any
velue, is that from A.D. 1173-1265. It occupies
pp. 153-196 of Vol. II. of ΜΓ. Thorpe’s edition, begin-
ning “Comes Sancti AEgidii” . . . and ending
. . . “feria secunda” It begins from the Orestion,
and is a compilation from various sources down to the
year 1257. From 1258-1265, when it terminates, it
is original, and it isfrom this latter portion that our
author has made his extract. The evidence of this
chronicle shows the author to have been a monk of

Bury St Edmund's, but beyond this nothing is known
