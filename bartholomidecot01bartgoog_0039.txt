book, which I believe to be Bartholomew Ootton’s ἓξὲξ]
own compilation. After a short introduction‚ taken from
from various authorities whose names are indicated 111dean
the margin, and a list of the kings of Englaud from <1⁰¹¹-
Caedwulla to Edward I.‚ with the length of their
reigns, he takes Hemy of Huntingdon for his guido,

and copies him closely—usually in the exact words,

with occasione] alterations, though frequently abridging

the matter,l down to the era of the Conqueet. The

only exception to this is the digression respectiug the
kingdoms of Kent, the East Angles, and East Saxona,

in pp. 25, 26, which is taken from Florenoe oi Wor-

cester. In p. 9 is the only account he gives himself

of his authorities, where after copying Henry of
Huntingdon's statement that he has followed Bede, he

adds, ‘¹ Deinde Henrici Hunt et W. Malmesbiriensis.’'

There is nothing directly hom Malmeebury (excepting

a very few extracta in the later portion of the history)

till we come to the Liber 111„ and as these are tho

only names mentioned, this ufforde on additional proof

of the bullr of the volume being by a different hand

to that which has compiled the beginning and the

end Of his method of abridglug, the account of the

death ol the brother of Athelstan will afford a good
