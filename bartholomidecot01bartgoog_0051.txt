PRErncn. ·xxxix

hostibus ruis indomitis et profugis
penes regern, vel suos delituisse.
Sed cum nullum ibidem reperisset,
accepto regis Scotorum homagio,
ad propria remeavit.

I think there can be little doubt that Bartholomew
Cotton hes here abridged Matthew· of Westminster,
and not the latter enlarged the former. The facts are
given in Matthew Paris, and probably Matthew cf
westminster obtained them thence; but it is his
abridgment that our historian has here used.

Agna, in p. 69,1. 7, anno 1153, the repetitiones the
mention of the death cf Pope Eugenius can only be
acccunted for cn the supposition cf two different
chroniclers being copied3 and Matthew of Westminstcr
mentions this, in contradistincticn tc Roga of Wendover,
under this year.

'l'he only conclusion at which I think we can arrive,
with any degree of probability, is that the N orwich
chronicler had access tc the earlier portion o'f the his·
tcry we now have under the name of Matthew cf
Westminster3 and thus that this latter chronicle was
composed at different periods The earlier portion may
‚very well heve formed the anneis cf some monastery,
and so have been lent to the N orwich monks for their
nse, and from its containing so many references to the
diocese of Norwich, which other chronicles do not con-
tain, possibly composed in a monastery in that diocese.

I proceed to show in what way the abridgrnent
cf thie portion has been performed, by giving in-
stances of its chief characteristiclrs, as hasbeen done
for the first portion.
