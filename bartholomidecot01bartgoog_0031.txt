cans, which he has 1111111111011111111001111111111111,11111111111111
“De Regibus Britonums’ the second,‘ ‘De Regibus
Anglia Dacis, et Normannis? and the third, “De
Archiopiscopis et Episcopis Angliae.'’ The Cotton MS.
begins with the second book, and the first book was
supposed to have beenlost entirely. It has, however,
recently been discovered in the British Museum¹ among
the Royal MSS. (Reg. 14. c. 1), and proves to 1111111111,
mere transuipt of the History of (leoffrey 01 Μο11111011111 110· ¹·
There is no title to this MS„ but the handwriting
und aize are exactly the same ae that 01 Nero. O. v.‚
and there is the same old red ohalk foliation indie·
tinctly seen at the foot of the leaves-the last number
in the Royal MS. being 58, and the first in the Cotton
MS. 59. This MS. is also bound up with others.
'l'he second book is also again divided into two parte,
the first carrying the history to the Conqueet. Alter
the mention of this event, the remainder 01 the leaf is
left blank, and the author, instead of going on from the
point where he leit off, begins entirely alresb, giving
a brief chronicls of a view 01 events picked out appa·
rently at rendam, from‘the birth 01 our Lord to the
Conquest, which is mentioned again in quite different
language (this only occupies a single pege of the MS„
pp. 4749) and then proceeds in a manner entirely
different 110111 before, his style, authorities, and method
of abridgment being at once and entirely changed The
history is pursued in the usual manner 01 the chroniclere,
giving the events under each year, and getting gradually
hiller as the author approaches his own time.
