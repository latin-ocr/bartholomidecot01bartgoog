p. 47. l. 11. , fratrem ey’us; the other editions insert
ot and ornit ejus; fratres, as all the MSS of H. H.
read, has been incorrectly altered by the copyist'

On the other hand it is necessary to observo the
following

ffigze- Iastcsucea os ha'a Diaaprceoacat arith MS. A. when

usA P. 11. l. 16. anaicm, the scene of Offa's battle
against the men of Kent. Here MS. A. rightly gives
Oltamsord.

p. 14. l. 9. rapueram MS. A. gives argumentosam

p. 28. l 23. quod; MS. A reads quc.

p. 29. l. 13. ewam ,· this is an abbreviation of tritum
repis. MS. A. has partem.

p. 34. l. 9. auaitum MS. A. reads puppibus.

Ib. l. 27. cognomento is evidently altered from cop-
